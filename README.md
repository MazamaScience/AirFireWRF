# AirFireWRF R Package

## Background

The Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model is a modern weather prediction 
system used for meteorological research and forecasting. WRF offers a flexible 
and computationally-efficient platform, while reflecting recent advances in 
physics, numerics, and data assimilation.

The **AirFireWRF** package is being developed to provide a simple tool for loading 
and visualizing WRF model output in R.
